## Problem

- level: easy
- topics: database

legit the only thing i was missing in my first submission was renaming the column. always check use case provided in the problem to see if the problem wants you to output the columns with specific names; it doesn't explicitly tell you in the requirement that it wants you to rename columns. 


## Leetcode Tips

- read problem's use case output to determine if renaming columns is necessary
