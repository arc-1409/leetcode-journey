## Problem

- level: easy
- topics: database
- cnit 272 exam prep: `inner join`, `date`

i struggled first with formatting the date condition right. the correct form is 'yyyy-mm-dd', not 'dd-MMM-yyyy' like in lab. i always use `between` to specify date ranges, but i discovered that the problem can also be solved with `year()` and `month()` methods; in that case i don't have to bother knowing which format the date is in. 

## Findings & Things Learnt

- the default date format is 'yyyy-mm-dd' in MySQL
- `year()` and `month()` returns the year and month
- `sum()`, not `count()`. silly mistake here.

## Leetcode Tips

- only use `having` clause for conditions specific to each row. the date condition should already be filtered BEFORE grouping by product name.
