## Problem

- level: easy
- topics: database
- cnit 272 exam prep: `inner join`, `date`

i overlooked that the table records temperature longitudinally, so it was meaningless to `inner join` on id numbers. use `inner join` of the same table on comparing dates, which gives us the record for yesterday, and then compare temperature. is it possible to use `outer join` on this?

## Findings & Things Learnt

- to compare date in MySQL, use `subdate(date1, [day_diff])`

## Leetcode Tips

- it is possible to specify join conditions using mathematical operations, such as the subtraction of dates!
