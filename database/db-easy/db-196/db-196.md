## Problem

- level: easy
- topics: database

`alter table [tablename] drop [column]` does not work here; it is invalid syntax. the problem statement requires the deletion of records, not columns, so `delete` should be used instead of `drop`. with that cleared, the syntax is the same as a `select` statement. 

## Findings & Things Learnt

- use `delete` to delete instances, or rows
- use `drop` to delete elements of the database, such as tables, columns, constraints

## Leetcode Tips

- to remove duplicates, `inner join` the same table and use `on` to compare the column in which there can be duplicates
