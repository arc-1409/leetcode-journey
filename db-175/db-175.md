## Problem

- level: easy
- topics: database

i thought of using `inner join` in the beginning, then remembered that to find instances in one table but isn't in another, `outer join` command is needed instead. i like `left join` better but for the sake of practice, i also did `right join`. 


## Findings & Things Learnt

- `left join` 
- `null` return value is the default when there is a missing instance in a `outer join` statement, do not need to manually specify
