# leetcode journey

this is simply where i'm going to keep my code, trial and errors, analyses, and insights as i go through leetcode problems. the goal is to try every problem with python, java, c, c++, and javascript––all of which i'm decently fluent but not enough. as i progress, this is going to look like a huge bank of knowledge and achievements, and it'll be very cool.
